EPilot

This is a machine learning project to help pilot's understand when the flight is going to have a hard landing, based on certain parameters like, climate, wind, temperature, and the previous data.

This is an executable project. To run this project, you need certain modules to be installed in the system.

Modules required:
1. Tkinter
2. Matplottlib
3. sklearn
4. pandas
5. numpy
6. keras.utils
7. tensorflow

Steps to run the project:
1. Download the Zipped file.
2. Extract the file.
3. Click on run.bat file. It is an executable file.
4. A tkinter GUI is opened.
5. CLick on the upload Dataset button, and upload your dataset.
6. Click on pre-process data. The data will be processed.
7. CLick on Run SVM algorithm.
8. Click on Run Logistic Regression algorithm.
9. CLick on Run AP2TD algorithm.
10. Click on Run AP2TH algorithm.
11. CLick on Run DH2TD algorithm.
12. Click on the Comparison Graph button.

And, there is the comparison graph of the AP2TD, AP2TH, SVM, logistic and DH2TD algorithm. 
By the comparison graph, we can tell which algorithm can precicely predict the hard landing.
